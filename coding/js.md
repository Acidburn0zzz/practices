# JS code standards

This document outlines the rules for writing Javascript documents and fragments across all of our codebases.

## Progressive Enhancement

JavaScript should progressively enhance a page.

On all publicly accessible websites, core content and functionality should still be available without JavaScript. JavaScript applications written for a more specific audience which won't be indexed by search engines may be more lax, but should still treat progressive enhancement as a guiding principle.

## Element hooks

We should target page element in Javascript using the `data-js` element attribute instead of using the class attribute. Classnames should be used for styling only.

e.g. `<a data-js="index-link" href="/index">Index</a>`

## Performance

- Cache DOM queries â€” only select an element once.
- Use event delegation as much as possible to reduce the number of events bound to the page
- Understand when you cause an element repaint and reduce inline style manipulations accordingly.
- If possible, always use CSS for element transforms and transitions.

## Style
