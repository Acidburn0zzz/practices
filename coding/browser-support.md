description: The browsers we officially support in our CSS and JavaScript
---

Our baseline browser support for our websites. There are two levels of support.

## Full support

Any browser with full support needs to be pixel perfect and all functionality should work.

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome | Should work 3 major versions back |
| Firefox | Should work 3 major versions back |
| Safari | latest |
| IE | 11 or greater |
| Edge | Latest |
| Opera | Should work 3 major versions back |

## Accessible support

The content on these browsers should be readable but it does not have to look perfect.

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome | 49 |
| Firefox | 45 |
| Edge | 14 |

Any browser not mentioned here is not supported and therefore not tested.

### Testing on different browsers

The team has an account with [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to test your site on browsers you don't have installed or different versions. You can find the teams email and password in our credentials document.
