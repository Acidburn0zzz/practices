Our baseline browser support for our websites. There are two levels of support. 

## Full support

Any browser with full support needs to be pixel perfect and all functionality should work.

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome | 55 or greater |
| Firefox | 52 or greater |
| Safari | 11 or greater |
| IE | 11 or greater |
| Edge | 15 or greater |
| Opera | 48 or greater |

## Accessible support

The content on these browsers should be readable but it does not have to look perfect.

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome | 49 |
| Firefox | 45 |
| Edge | 14 |

Any browser not mentioned here is not supported and therefore not tested.

### Testing on different browsers

The team has an account with [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to test your site on browsers you don't have installed or different versions. You can find the teams email and password in our credentials document.
