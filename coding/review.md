# Code Review

## Suggestions for Effective Review

[tbd]

## Etiquette

### Approval with suggestions for trivial changes
In some circumstances, if a branch requires a small number of trivial changes you may approve the branch with the caveat that issues you've identified are resolved or considered, rather than marking the branch *needs fixing* (lp) or *request changes* (gh). These changes should be in the category of minor adjustments to file structure, fixing typos, renamings, small css tweaks etc.

Typically if you have co-workers available to you in your timezone, you should seek an additional review if possible.
