# Code Review

## Suggestions for Effective Review

[tbd]

## Etiquette

### Approval with suggestions for trivial changes
In some circumstances, if a branch requires a small number of trivial changes you may approve the branch with the caveat that issues you've identified are resolved or considered, rather than marking the branch *needs fixing* (lp) or *request changes* (gh). These changes should be in the category of minor adjustments to file structure, fixing typos, renamings, small css tweaks etc.

If you are the branch author, it is your responsibility to ensure you have addressed these suggestions before merging your branch.

Typically if you have co-workers available to you in your timezone, you should seek an additional review if possible.
