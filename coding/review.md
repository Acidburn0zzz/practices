# Code Review

## Suggestions for Effective Review

[tbd]

## Etiquette
Take care not to block landings for branches that only need minor changes.

If a branch requires a small number of changes, favour approving the branch with a caveat that the issues you've identified are resolved, rather than *needs fixing*[launchpad] or *request changes*[github]. Marking a branch *needs fixing* should be reserved for genuinely broken code, when the author has proposed the wrong solution, or when the code still requires considerable work to be production ready.
