# Code formatting

To ensure consistency across our codebases, we utilise [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

## JavaScript

JS should also be written using [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style. New projects can adhere to this by selecting 'AirBnB' during `eslint init`, and existing projects can find the relevant eslint config in [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

## Usage

You should configure your text editor to work with these tools - plugins are available for Atom, Sublime and VS Code.

These tools should be used on all new projects and on legacy projects where possible and feasible.
