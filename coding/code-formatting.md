# Code formatting

To ensure consistency across our codebases, we utilise [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) with [ESlint](https://eslint.org/).

For ESlint, we use [the AirBnB config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

You should configure your text editor to work with these tools - plugins are available for Atom, sublime and VS Code.

These tools should be used on all new projects and on legacy projects where possible and feasible.
