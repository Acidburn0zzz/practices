Guidelines for contributing to webteam-practices
===

This repository contains best practices specifically for the Canonical Webteam.

Anyone is welcome to suggest improvements in one of two ways:

- Start a discussion by submitting [a new issue](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/webteam-practices/issues/new)
- Suggest a change by submitting a pull request ([how?](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/))

## Submitting suggestions

### Collaborating on large documents

The process of approving small pull-requests can seem overly cumbersome when trying to add significant amounts of content. This will likely be most difficult more towards the project's inception, when there's still not much content, and become less relevant over time.

To get around this it may make more sense to ask the team to collaborate on long documents in an interactive writing tool like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), where many people can quickly build up a shared vision.

The parts of the newly created document should then be submitted as pull requests in the normal way, subject to all the normal rules of approval, but if most of the relevant team members were already involved in the collaborative phase then approval should go by much more easily.

Approving a pull request
---

Before a pull request is approved and merged:

- A reasonable effort should be made to bring it to the attention of the whole team
- It should also have been :+1:d by at least 2 team members
- It should have been open for at least 24 hours

Once it is merged, it should be brought up in the next relevant team meeting to ensure the whole team is aware of the change.
