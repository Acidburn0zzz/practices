Anyone is welcome to suggest improvements in one of two ways:

Approving a pull request

Before a pull request is approved and merged:

- A reasonable effort should be made to bring it to the attention of the whole team
- It should also have been :+1:d by at least 2 team members
- It should have been open for at least 24 hours

Once it is merged, it should be brought up in the next relevant team meeting to ensure the whole team is aware of the change.
