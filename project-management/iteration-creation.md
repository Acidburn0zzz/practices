## Create a milestone

Go to your squads repo and create a milestone titled: Iteration {number}-{week} {date from} - {date to} for example: Iteration 18-47 20th November - 3rd December.

## Create a small task epic

Create a new epic on the squad repo and attach it to the new milestone.

## Set up the backlog

Firstly, rename the sections of the backlog from `Current iteration:` to `Previous iteration`. Then rename `Next iteration` to `Current iteration`. Then create a new row titled `Next iteration` below `Current iteration.

Move all incomplete epics down from the `Previous iteration` to the `Current iteration` section. Apart from the small tasks epic. Instead reassign all small tasks to the new small tasks in this iteration.

This should result in the `Previous iteration` being 100% complete. You may now hide the iteration rows.

Pull up the epics that are proitised from this iteration.

Be sure to check the `sum` cells are current.

## Assinging issues to small tasks

Once you have completed you planning and know how many points you can still take on in the iteration. Scroll though the Triaged pipeline and choose a number of high, medium and low issues.

I would suggest a ratio of 3 high, 2 medium and 1 small.

This allows for a curn of low priority issues to be resolved reguarly.

## Assign the milestone to the epic and cards

Once you have organised the backlog and you know which epics you are taking on. Highlight each epic and move them to the Iteration epics pipeline and assign the newly created milestone. You can then show all cards for this epic via the board view. Select each issue and move them to the current iteration pipeline and also assign them to the milestone.

You are now ready to take on your next iteration
